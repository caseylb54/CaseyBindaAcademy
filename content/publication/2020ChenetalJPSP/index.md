abstract: "Physiological linkage refers to the degree to which peoples' physiological\
  \ responses change in coordinated ways. Here, we examine whether and how physiological\
  \ linkage relates to incidents of shared emotion, distinguished by valence. Past\
  \ research has used an \\\"overall average\\\" approach and characterized how physiological\
  \ linkage over relatively long time periods (e.g., 10-15 min) reflects psychological\
  \ and social processes (e.g., marital satisfaction, empathy). Here, we used a \\\
  \"momentary\\\" approach and characterized whether physiological linkage over relatively\
  \ short time periods (i.e., 15 s) reflects shared positive emotion, shared negative\
  \ emotion, or both, and whether linkage during shared emotions relates to relational\
  \ functioning. Married couples (156 dyads) had a 15-min conflict conversation in\
  \ the laboratory. Using behavioral coding, each second of conversation was classified\
  \ into 1 of 4 emotion categories: shared positive emotion, shared negative emotion,\
  \ shared neutral emotion, or unshared emotion. Using a composite of 3 peripheral\
  \ physiological measures (i.e., heart rate, skin conductance, finger pulse amplitude),\
  \ we computed momentary in-phase and antiphase linkage to represent coordinated\
  \ changes in the same or opposite direction, respectively. We found that shared\
  \ positive emotion was associated with higher in-phase and lower antiphase linkage,\
  \ relative to the other 3 emotion categories. Greater in-phase physiological linkage\
  \ during shared positive emotion was also consistently associated with higher-quality\
  \ interactions and relationships, both concurrently and longitudinally (i.e., 5\
  \ to 6 years later). These findings advance our understanding of the nature of physiological\
  \ linkage, the emotional conditions under which it occurs, and its possible associations\
  \ with relational functioning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights\
