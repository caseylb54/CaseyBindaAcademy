abstract: "We thank Fox et al. (2014) for their interest
in our research and welcome this opportunity to respond to their commentary.
They argue that participants in our studies enjoyed “just thinking” more than we
claimed (Wilson et al., 2014). We found
some irony in their position, because we
began this line of research with a similar hypothesis. As the data came in we
were surprised that participants did not
enjoy deliberative thought very much,
even when we went to some lengths to give
them time to prepare and choose their topics (i.e., in our “prompted fantasy” conditions). We are thus in the rather amusing
position of explaining why both Fox et al.’s
interpretation and our initial hypotheses
are wrong."
