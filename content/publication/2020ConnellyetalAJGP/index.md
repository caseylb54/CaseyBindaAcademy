abstract: "Introduction:Caring for a spouse with dementia can be extremely challenging.\
  \ Many caregivers experience profound declines in well-being; however, others remain\
  \ healthy. Objective: This study determined whether the personal pronouns used in\
  \ interactions between persons with dementia (PWDs) and their spousal caregivers\
  \ were associated with caregiver well-being. Methods: Fifty-eight PWDs and their\
  \ spousal caregivers engaged in a 10-min conversation about an area of disagreement\
  \ in a laboratory setting. Verbatim transcripts of the conversation were coded using\
  \ text analysis software, and caregivers and PWDs each received scores for (a) I-pronouns,\
  \ (b) you-pronouns, and (c) we-pronouns. Caregivers' well-being was assessed using\
  \ a composite measure of depression, anxiety, burden, and strain. Results: Results\
  \ revealed that less use of we-pronouns by caregivers and PWDs and greater use of\
  \ I-pronouns by PWDs were -associated with lower caregiver well-being. Conclusions:\
  \ These findings indicate that less use of pronouns that refer to the couple (we-pronouns\
  \ used by either partner) and greater use of pronouns that refer to the PWD (I-pronouns\
  \ used by the PWD) are indicative of caregivers at heightened risk for lower well-being."
