abstract: OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that a functional polymorphism of the serotonin
  transporter gene (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]), which
  is thought to be associated with differential environmental sensitivity, moderates
  the association between low levels of empathic accuracy (i.e., ability to recognize
  emotions in others) in patients with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers' well-being.
  METHODS Participants were 54 patients with neurodegenerative disease and their caregivers.
  Patients' empathic accuracy was measured using a dynamic tracking task in which
  they continuously rated the emotions of a character in a film; accuracy was determined
  by comparing patient ratings with those made by an expert panel. Caregivers provided
  a saliva sample for genotyping. Caregivers' well-being was measured as a latent
  construct indicated by validated measures of depression, anxiety, and negative affect.
  RESULTS Lower levels of patients' empathic accuracy were associated with lower levels
  of caregivers' well-being. Importantly, caregivers' 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated
  this association such that lower empathic accuracy in patients predicted lower well-being
  for caregivers with the short/short genotype (standardized $β$ = 0.66), but not
  for caregivers with the short/long (standardized $β$ = 0.05) or long/long genotypes
  (standardized $β$ = −0.21). CONCLUSION Consistent with previous findings that the
  short/short variant of 5-HTTLPR is associated with greater sensitivity to environmental
  influences, caregivers with the short/short variant manifest lower well-being when
  caring for a patient with low levels of empathic accuracy than caregivers with the
  other variants. This finding contributes to the authors' understanding of biological
  factors associated with individual differences in caregiver vulnerability and resilience.
