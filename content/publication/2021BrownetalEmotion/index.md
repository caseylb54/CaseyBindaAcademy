abstract: "Motivated by collective emotions theories that propose emotions shared between
individuals predict group level qualities, we hypothesized that co-experienced affect
during interactions is associated with relationship quality, above and beyond the effects
of individually-experienced affect. Consistent with Positivity Resonance Theory, we also
hypothesized that co-experienced positive affect would have a stronger association with
relationship quality than co-experienced negative affect. We tested these hypotheses in
150 married couples across three conversational interactions: a conflict, neutral, and
pleasant topic. Spouses continuously rated their individual affective experience during
each conversation while watching video-recordings of their interactions. These individual
affect ratings were used to determine, for positive and negative affect separately, the
number of seconds of co-experienced affect and individually-experienced affect during
each conversation. In line with hypotheses, results from all three conversational topics
suggest that more co-experienced positive affect is associated with greater marital
quality, whereas more co-experienced negative affect is associated with worse marital
quality. Individual level affect factors added little explanatory value beyond coexperienced affect. Comparing co-experienced positive affect and co-experienced
negative affect, co-experienced positive affect generally outperformed co-experienced
negative affect, although co-experienced negative affect was especially diagnostic during
the pleasant conversational topic. Findings suggest co-experienced positive affect may be
an integral component of high-quality relationships and highlight the power of coexperienced affect for individual perceptions of relationship quality.."
