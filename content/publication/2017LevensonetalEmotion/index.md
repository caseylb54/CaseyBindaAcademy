abstract: 'INTRODUCTION Emotion has historically
  played a central role in psychophysiological research, with rich traditions focusing
  on both central and peripheral nervous system measures. A central tenet of most
  functionalist/evolutionary theories is that emotions prepare the organism for dealing
  effectively and efficiently with threats, challenges, and opportunities (Levenson,
  1994). Thus, research has arisen around the actions that occur (the “motion” part
  of emotion), which are largely subserved by the somatic nervous system, and the
  metabolic support for these actions, which is largely subserved by the autonomic
  nervous system (ANS). In this chapter, we focus primarily on the role the ANS plays
  in emotion and the ways it can best be studied. THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS Emotion
  research has been strongly influenced by a number of opposing theoretical positions,
  some of which have been debated for over a century: (a) discrete versus dimensional;
  (b) hard-wired versus socially constructed; and (c) universal versus culture-specific.
  Although psychophysiological research is often viewed as being primarily data-,
  phenomenon-, and methodology-driven, these theoretical debates have had important
  influences on the ways this research is conducted. Moreover, psychophysiological
  studies have provided valuable data that are often used (and misused) in theoretical
  debates about the nature of emotion. Arguably most important for psychophysiological
  research is the discrete versus dimensional debate, which centers on the differences
  among emotion. In discrete emotions theories, a limited number of distinct emotions
  can be distinguished from each other in terms of structural features (e.g., facial
  expression, ANS activity) and functions (e.g., preparation for fight, preparation
  for flight). Discrete emotions are often seen as “natural kinds” (Matsumoto & Willingham,
  2006; Panksepp, 2000), with their sources found in the structure of the natural
  world. In contrast, dimensional theories do not envision distinct emotions, but
  rather allow for a large (perhaps unlimited) number of emotional states that are
  located within a dimensional space defined by one or more descriptors. Dimensional
  approaches that are prominent in the psychophysiological literature include: (a)
  a two-dimensional model that includes valence (negative-positive) and arousal (low-high),
  and (b) a single-dimensional model comprised by a motivational or action tendency
  dimension (approach-avoidance). Although discrete and dimensional models can be
  combined (e.g., locating a discrete emotion such as fear in negative valence/high
  arousal dimensional space), these theoretical models have often led to very different
  research paradigms...'
