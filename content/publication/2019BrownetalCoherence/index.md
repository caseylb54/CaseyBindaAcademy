abstract: Emotion theorists have characterized emotions as involving coherent responding
  across various emotion response systems (e.g., covariation of subjective experience
  and physiology). Greater response system coherence has been theorized to promote
  well-being, yet very little research has tested this assumption. The current study
  examined whether individuals with greater coherence between physiology and subjective
  experience of emotion report greater well-being. We also examined factors that may
  predict the magnitude of coherence, such as emotion intensity, cognitive reappraisal,
  and expressive suppression. Participants (N = 63) completed self-report measures
  of well-being, expressive suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. They then watched
  a series of emotionally evocative film clips designed to elicit positive and negative
  emotion. During the films, participants continuously rated their emotional experience
  using a rating dial, and their autonomic physiological responses were recorded.
  Time-lagged cross-correlations were used to calculate within-participant coherence
  between intensity of emotional experience (ranging from neutral to very negative
  or very positive) and physiology (composite of cardiac interbeat interval, skin
  conductance, ear pulse transit time, finger pulse transit time and amplitude, systolic
  and diastolic blood pressure). Results indicated that individuals with greater coherence
  reported greater well-being. Coherence was highest during the most emotionally intense
  film and among individuals who reported lower expressive suppression. However, coherence
  was not associated with reappraisal. These findings provide support for the idea
  that greater emotion coherence promotes well-being and also shed light on factors
  that are associated with the magnitude of coherence.
