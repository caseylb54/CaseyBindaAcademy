abstract: In order to develop more targeted, efficient, and effective psychotherapeutic
  interventions, calls have been made in the literature for greater use of idiographic
  hypothesis testing. Idiographic analyses can provide useful information regarding
  mechanisms of change within individuals over time during treatment. However, it
  remains unclear how clinicians might utilize idiographic statistical analyses during
  routine treatment to test clinical hypotheses, and in turn, guide treatment. We
  present an idiographic statistical framework for clinical hypothesis testing with
  routine treatment data that enables clinicians to examine a) whether the client's
  symptoms and hypothesized mechanisms change over time, b) whether trajectories of
  change reflect the timing of interventions, c) whether mechanisms predict subsequent
  symptoms, and d) whether relationships exist between multiple mechanisms, symptoms,
  or other treatment-related constructs over time. We demonstrate the utility of the
  approach for clinical hypothesis testing by applying it to routine treatment data
  collected from a 56 year-old male who presented with a combination of anger problems,
  anxiety, and depressive symptoms. We discuss how results from analyses can inform
  the case-formulation and guide clinical decision-making. We aim to make these methods
  more accessible by providing an online platform where clinicians can enter client
  data, test their clinical hypotheses using idiographic analyses, and utilize the
  results to disseminate their findings.
