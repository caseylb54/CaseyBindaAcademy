abstract: Deficits in emotion perception (the ability to infer others' emotions accurately)
  can occur as a result of neurodegeneration. It remains unclear how different neurodegenerative
  diseases affect different forms of emotion perception. The present study compares
  performance on a dynamic tracking task of emotion perception (where participants
  track the changing valence of a film character's emotions) with performance on an
  emotion category labeling task (where participants label specific emotions portrayed
  by film characters) across seven diagnostic groups (N = 178) including Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant
  primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia
  (nfvPPA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome and healthy
  controls. Consistent with hypotheses, compared to controls, the bvFTD group was
  impaired on both tasks. The svPPA group was impaired on the emotion labeling task,
  whereas the nfvPPA, PSP and AD groups were impaired on the dynamic tracking task.
  Smaller volumes in bilateral frontal and left insular regions were associated with
  worse labeling, whereas smaller volumes in bilateral medial frontal, temporal and
  right insular regions were associated with worse tracking. Findings suggest labeling
  and tracking facets of emotion perception are differentially affected across neurodegenerative
  diseases due to their unique neuroanatomical correlates.
