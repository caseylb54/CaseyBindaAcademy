abstract: 'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a neurodegenerative disease broadly characterized
  by socioemotional impairments, includes three clinical subtypes: behavioral variant
  FTD (bvFTD), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and non-fluent
  variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). Emerging evidence has shown emotional
  reactivity impairments in bvFTD and svPPA, whereas emotional reactivity in nfvPPA
  is far less studied. In 105 patients with FTD (49 bvFTD, 31 svPPA and 25 nfvPPA)
  and 27 healthy controls, we examined three aspects of emotional reactivity (physiology,
  facial behavior and subjective experience) in response to a sad film. In a subset
  of the sample, we also examined the neural correlates of diminished aspects of reactivity
  using voxel-based morphometry. Results indicated that all three subtypes of FTD
  showed diminished physiological responding in respiration rate and diastolic blood
  pressure; patients with bvFTD and svPPA also showed diminished subjective experience,
  and no subtypes showed diminished facial behavior. Moreover, there were differences
  among the clinical subtypes in brain regions where smaller volumes were associated
  with diminished sadness reactivity. These results show that emotion impairments
  extend to sadness reactivity in FTD and underscore the importance of considering
  different aspects of sadness reactivity in multiple clinical subtypes for characterizing
  emotional deficits and associated neurodegeneration in FTD.'
