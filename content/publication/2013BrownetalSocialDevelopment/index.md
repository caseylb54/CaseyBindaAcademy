abstract: 'Using multi-informant data drawn from a prospective study involving 184
  youth, mother-perpetrated and father-perpetrated partner aggression during early
  adolescence (the age of 13) was examined as a predictor of five types of disengagement
  coping strategies in emerging adulthood (the age of 21): behavioral disengagement,
  mental disengagement, denial, substance use, and restraint. The ability to develop
  close friendships, or friendship competence, was examined as a moderator of these
  links. Results suggest that inter-parent aggression in early adolescence can predict
  reliance on disengagement coping 8 years later, but that friendship competence can
  buffer against the reliance on disengagement coping. Moreover, close friendship
  competence was not directly related to partner aggression by mothers or fathers,
  suggesting that friendship competence develops along an independent developmental
  track and thus may truly serve as a buffer for young adults with a history of exposure
  to inter-parent aggression.'
