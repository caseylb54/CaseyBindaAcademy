abstract: "Objectives: To investigate whether deficits in empathic accuracy (i.e.,\
  \ ability to recognize emotion in others) in patients with neurodegenerative disease\
  \ are associated with greater depression in their caregivers. Design: Two cross-sectional\
  \ studies. Setting: Academic medical center and research university. Participants:\
  \ Two independent samples (N = 172, N = 63) of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative\
  \ diseases and their caregivers; comparison group of healthy couples. Measurement:\
  \ Patients' empathic accuracy was assessed in the laboratory using a novel dynamic\
  \ tracking task (rating another person's changing emotions over time) and more traditional\
  \ measures (recognizing the emotion expressed in photographs of facial expressions\
  \ and by characters in films). Caregivers completed self-report inventories of depression.\
  \ Results: Lower empathic accuracy in patients was associated with greater depression\
  \ in caregivers in both studies. In study 1, this association was found when empathic\
  \ accuracy was measured using the dynamic tracking measure but not when measured\
  \ using the more traditional photograph and film measures. In study 2, we found\
  \ preliminary support for our theoretical model wherein lower empathic accuracy\
  \ in patients is associated with increased caregiver stress (loneliness, strain,\
  \ and burden), which in turn is associated with greater caregiver depression. Conclusions:\
  \ Caring for a patient with deficits in empathic accuracy is associated with greater\
  \ loneliness, strain, and burden for caregivers, and increased depression. Caregivers\
  \ may benefit from interventions designed to compensate for the stress and interpersonal\
  \ loss associated with patients' declining empathic accuracy."
