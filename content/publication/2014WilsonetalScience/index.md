abstract: In 11 studies, we found that participants typically did not enjoy spending
  6 to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think, that they
  enjoyed doing mundane external activities much more, and that many preferred to
  administer electric shocks to themselves instead of being left alone with their
  thoughts. Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing,
  even if that something is negative.
