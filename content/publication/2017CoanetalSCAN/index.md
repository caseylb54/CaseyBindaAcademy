abstract: Â© The Author (2017). Strong social ties correspond with better health and
  well being, but the neural mechanisms linking social contact to health remain speculative.
  This study extends work on the social regulation of brain activity by supportive
  handholding in 110 participants (51 female) of diverse racial and socioeconomic
  origins. In addition to main effects of social regulation by handholding, we assessed
  the moderating effects of both perceived social support and relationship status
  (married, cohabiting, dating or platonic friends). Results suggest that, under threat
  of shock, handholding by familiar relational partners attenuates both subjective
  distress and activity in a network associated with salience, vigilance and regulatory
  self-control. Moreover, greater perceived social support corresponded with less
  brain activity in an extended network associated with similar processes, but only
  during partner handholding. In contrast, we did not observe any regulatory effects
  of handholding by strangers, and relationship status did not moderate the regulatory
  effects of partner handholding. These findings suggest that contact with a familiar
  relational partner is likely to attenuate subjective distress and a variety of neural
  responses associated with the presence of threat. This effect is likely enhanced
  by an individual's expectation of the availability of support from their wider social
  network.
