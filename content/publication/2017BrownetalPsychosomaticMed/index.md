abstract: Objective Social support is associated with better health. This association
  may be partly mediated through the social regulation of adrenomedullary activity
  related to poor cardiovascular health and glucocorticoid activity known to inhibit
  immune functioning. These physiological cascades originate in the hypothalamic areas
  that are involved in the neural response to threat. The aim of the study investigated
  whether the down regulation, by social support, of hypothalamic responses to threat
  is associated with better subjective health. Methods A diverse community sample
  of seventy-five individuals, aged 23 to 26 years, were recruited from an ongoing
  longitudinal study. Participants completed the Short Form Health Survey, a well-validated
  self-report measure used to assess subjective general health. They were scanned,
  using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during a threat of shock paradigm involving
  various levels of social support, which was manipulated using handholding from a
  close relational partner, a stranger, and an alone condition. We focused on a hypothalamic
  region of interest derived from an independent sample to examine the association
  between hypothalamic activity and subjective general health. Results Results revealed
  a significant interaction between handholding condition and self-reported general
  health (F(2,72) = 3.53, p =.032, partial $η$2 = 0.05). Down regulation of the hypothalamic
  region of interest during partner handholding corresponded with higher self-ratings
  of general health (ß =-0.31, p =.007). Conclusions Higher self-ratings of general
  health correspond with decreased hypothalamic activity during a task that blends
  threat with supportive handholding. These results suggest that associations between
  social support and health are partly mediated through the social regulation of hypothalamic
  sensitivity to threat.
