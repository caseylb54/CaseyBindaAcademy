Casey is a postdoctoral fellow in the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory. She earned her PhD in clinical psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, after completing her clinical internship at the University of California, San Francisco. Before graduate school, she served as the Project Coordinator of the Virginia Affective Neuroscience Laboratory and received her BA in psychology and cognitive science from the University of Virginia.

Casey’s research examines how we share, understand, and influence one another’s emotions. She’s interested in how these interpersonal emotional processes are beneficial for health, and how these processes go awry. Her research uses an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach drawing from social psychology and clinical affective neuroscience to inform and advance interventions that improve socio-emotional functioning. She works with individuals who have neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as neurotypical individuals, and studies a number of different forms of social connections across the lifespan.
